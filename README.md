# PHP-MVC-Skelethon

Hello, this is a really simple PHP MVC Skelethon which I've made to understand better the MVC pattern in PHP. For doing this skelethon I got helped by of course internet tutorials and my best friend stackoverflow.

I have exported my own database as example user.sql.

At the moment with the skelethon you can pass a name via the url or create an user via url. I know thats not the proper way to create an user but this was just for learning purpose.
