# PHP-MVC-Skelethon

Hello, this is a really simple PHP MVC Skelethon which I've made to understand better the MVC pattern in PHP. For doing this skelethon I got helped by of course internet tutorials and my best friend stackoverflow.

You can create your own database and model or you can use my example from user.sql

At the moment with the skelethon you can pass a name via the url or create an user via url. I know thats not the proper way to create an user but this was just for learning purpose.
